Technology can aid forest management in many ways, such as:
1.       Using aerial remote sensing to create high-resolution tree inventory and monitor forest health and productivity.
2.       Applying artificial intelligence to analyze urban forest data and optimize urban planning and management.
3.       Developing precision forestry practices that use data-driven, AI-supported tools to improve forest operations and sustainability.
4.       Employing robotics and automation to assist with forest harvesting, thinning, planting, and firefighting.
5.       Utilizing geospatial information retrieval to access and integrate diverse forest-related data sources and support decision-making.
